                    <p class="lead"> It only takes two to four hours a week to achieve a general improvement to your
                        health. Cycling is:
                        <br><strong>Low impact –</strong>it causes less strain and injuries than most other forms of
                        exercise.
                        <br><strong>A good muscle workout–</strong> cycling uses all of the major muscle groups as you
                        pedal.
                        <br><strong>Easy - </strong>unlike some other sports, cycling does not require high levels of
                        physical skill. Most people know how to ride a bike and, once you learn, you don’t forget.
                        <br><strong>Good for strength and stamina–</strong>cycling increases stamina, strength and
                        aerobic fitness.
                        <br><strong>As intense as you want–</strong> cycling can be done at very low intensity to begin
                        with, if recovering from injury or illness, but can be built up to a demanding physical workout.
                        <br><strong>A fun way to get fit–</strong> the adventure and buzz you get from coasting down
                        hills and being outdoors means you are more likely to continue to cycle regularly, compared to
                        other physical activities that keep you indoors or require special times or places.
                        <br><strong>Time-efficient –</strong> as a mode of transport, cycling replaces sedentary
                        (sitting) time spent driving motor vehicles or using trams, trains or buses with healthy
                        exercise.
