                    <p class="lead">1.) Eating at a fixed time is the first and most important food habit. It will keep
                        you away from GERD, acidity, gas, and constipation.
                        <br>2.) Drinking too much water while eating will dilute digestive juices and make them
                        ineffective. Not drinking water at all while eating will reduce the consistency of the food and
                        again there will be a problem in digestion. One should drink almost half a glass of water while
                        eating.
                        <br>3.) Soups, starters or some light snacks should be taken 20 min before eating. This will
                        trigger the release of digestive juices and will ready a perfect environment for digestion.
                        <br>4.) While eating, when you fell like your tummy is full but you will be able to take a small
                        amount more for your taste buds, stop there, don't take that extra.
                        <br>5.) Eating Ginger while having heavy meals will make the meal safe for your digestive
                        system.
                        <br>6.) Drinking too much cold water while eating will reduce vitamin and minerals absorption in
                        the stomach. As many vitamin's and mineral's dissolution time increases in cold water.
                        <br>7.) Nowadays it has become necessary to soak vegetables in slight hot water before using
                        them. As many pesticides are there on their skin which is removed after soaking in hot water.
                        <br>8.) Eating polished Toor dal, rice, etc. will not be good as their nutritions will be lost
                        while polishing.
                        <br>9.) Eating pure cow ghee doesn't lead in increase of fat in body but not eating it will
                        bring early ageing to your joints especially knees.
